# Xrm-WebApi-Client

This is a framework for easing working with the Dynamics CRM WebApi using JavaScript.
It uses the awesome [BlueBird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) framework for handling requests asynchronously based on promises.
Currently this is still in development, the first release will feature CRUD operations and will be released soon.
